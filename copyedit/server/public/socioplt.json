Table \\ref{popularity_data} compares the six most popular languages of our surveys against the TIOBE index, which measures the volume of web search results for programming languages~                . The tables suggest that our survey samples are broadly in alignment with one another and with the TIOBE survey. Differences appear attributable to details in question wording. For example, programmers might use CSS and XML regularly, but not think of it as a programming language unless prompted to include it. They might use SQL, but not consider themselves experts. Finally, they might use a shell scripting language, but not consider it important. We performed similar grounding comparisons against other results throughout our work.\n", "spans": [[0, 67], [68, 267], [268, 379], [380, 443], [444, 578], [579, 635], [636, 718], [719, 805]], "file": "../../../../spindles/bb/leo-personal/socio/oopsla13/sec2-methodology.tex"}

Second,  ecological models may apply to language adoption as we hypothesized in earlier work~                        .
